            <p>The brothers were fearless! They ravaged make-believe towns like Viking Berserkers; sunk ships on the high seas like Cutthroat Pirates; blasted their way across the universe like Rogue Space Bandits; and robbed imaginary banks like Devilish Outlaws. The brothers had wild fin, but their games would always end with <em>someone</em> getting hurt, and that <em>someone</em> was always Omari, the younger brother.</p>

I'm through worrying about stepping on a landmine every time I want to run through the grass like a cheetah."</p>
