            <p>Back at camp, Eric and Crom got to work building the first Frog Croak Powered Engine. Omari and Oats took charge of combining the two broken ships with Armadillo Fish scales, while the birds calibrated the Cloud Leaf wings. Eric puffed out his chest and announced when the ship was finally finished, "This spaceship may be the best thing I've ever seen in my life, and we built it together." He looked over at his little brother and said, "Omari, as long as we stick together, there's nothing we can't do."</p>

            <p>That night was a night of celebration. Fur and feathers flew all over the place. Eric and Omari taught Crom how to dance like an uncontrollable madman. Oats barked and howled while his new little monkey friend shrieked and squaked happily. Crom even made the brothers flutes so they could play along with the wild bird songs.</p>
            <p>THE NEW SHIP WAS FINISHED!</p>
