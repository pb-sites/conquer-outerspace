            <p>Eric and Omari Thatcher were banned from just about every single house, playground, school, and backyard in Stubbsville. They were chased out of the library for playing Barbarian Invaders in the history section and banished from the town fountain for thrashing about wildly like writhing Sea Serpents. The brothers acted at all times like Horrible Monsters from Outer Space.</p>

            <p>An who knows really, maybe they were from outer space. Eric and Omari Thatcher were <em>NOT</em> nice, they were <em>NOT</em> good at making friends, and they absoluetly did <em>NOT</em> stop to say, "Hello, how are you today?". They GROWLED! They lived in a tree fort outside of town and played wild reckless games in the woods. Every morning they started their day by swinging through the trees howling like crazed spider monkeys.</p>
