            <p>The monster looked at the two scrawny space travelers and laughed and laughed. He laughed so hard the cave shook and boulders dropped from the ceiling.</p>
            <p>"Well," the monster said trying to catch his breath, "usually I eat any spacemen who wander into this cave. But I like you, Eric, and I already ate my fill of spacemen today." The monster wiped tears of laughter from his many eyes. He shook Eric's hand, "My name is Crom and I am the moset well-known explorer on this planet."</p>

            <p>Crom the explorer took out a beaten-up, old book and said, "How about this? Instead of eating you, I'll help you find your little brother." The monster flipped through page after page of incredible maps, drawings of galaxies, and sketches of strange animals.</p>
            <p>"Ah here we are," Crom said. "I've been exploring the underground rivers on this planet. We can take this river <em>here</em>," the monster pointed, "all the way to the Hollow Mountain. From the top we'll be able to see exactly where your brother's ship crashed."</p>
