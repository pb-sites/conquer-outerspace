            <p>Eric could see clear across the planet for miles through Crom's specially designed, three-eyed telescope. He could see everything: his home planet, the swirling every-colored sands of strange deserts, gigantic crystals made of ice and snow in the north, and even his own crashed rocket ship; but Omari was nowhere to be seen.</p>
