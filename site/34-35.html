            <p>The Lightning Monkeys lived miles above the ground in a forest made of clouds. They used their large metal teeth to eat lightning bolts right out of the sky. These monkeys were wildly hungry and absolutely crazed with electricity at all times.</p>
            <p>With crystals ready, the friends landed in the Cloud Forest and were immediately surrounded by a gang of shrieking monkeys with lightning crackling through their teeth.</p>
            <p>Afraid of nothing and crazier than any mad beast, Omari held out a candy crystal and said, "Alright you monkeys, I'll give this crystal to the first one of you animals who can make me laugh."</p>

            <p>One small, shy monkey looked Omari in the eyes, and with a belly full of lightning bolts, burped a thunderous belch that exploded and sparked out of the monkey's mouth like a firecracker. Eric had never seen Omari laugh so hard in his life. He laughed so much that the monkeys started laughing too. Soon everyone was rolling around on the ground, crying and laughing their guts out, the best of friends.</p>
            <p>Later, chomping on their tasty crystals, the monkeys gladly let Crom climb high up into the Cloud Forest to pick a pair of incredibly sturdy but lighter than air Cloud Leaves. The brothers had their wings!</p>
