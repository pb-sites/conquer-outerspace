            <p>Eric and Oats climbed into Crom's boat and took off down the Underground River. The river was fast and dangerous but worse yet, it was damp and cold down there! Crom started telling funny stories to warm up the two brave but underdressed travelers. In no time at all, Eric jumped in with his own stories and had Crom laughing so hard the monster almost fell out of the boar! Eric knew he'd finally found a true friend, even if that friend had three eyes, could tear a tree out of the ground with his bare hands, and could bite a horse in half with one quick snap of his jaws.</p>

            <p>The boat twisted and turned down the Underground River until it stopped in the middle of the Hollow Mountain. Crom explained, "Millions of years ago, rain started leaking through a small crack in the top of the mountain. Over thousands and thousands of years the rain water slowly cut into the guts of the mountain until the whole thing was as hollow as an empty soda bottle."</p>
            <p>Crom docked the boat and the three friends climbed up a ladder through swarms of glowing bugs until they reached the top of the Hollow Mountain and climbed outside.</p>
