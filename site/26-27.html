            <p>Eric tried punching the birds in the face but they were just too strong. He could hear Oats barking and biting behind him. "What are these things, Crom?" Eric shouted, but Crom was too busy fighting and kicking to hear him. The birds flew the friends deep into the woods and dropped them below a massive tree. Perched in the branches say an entire army of squawking red birds. In the middle of the squadron, Eric saw a crashed rocket shop, and beside it stood Omari... and he looked very, very, very ANGRY.</p>
            <p>Eric called up to his brother, "Omari, I'm here to save you!"</p>

            <p>The red birds burst into laughter. Surrounded by his flock, Omari called down from the branches, "Eric, I don't need saving. These birds are my <em>friends</em>, they don't try to hurt me every single chance they get." The bids glared down at Eric. "If you even think about tricking me again," Omari said, "my new bird friends will bite your arms off."</p>
            <p>Eric shouted back, "I swear, if I ever trick you again, your bird friends can bite my legs off, too! I really missed you, Omari; life is just awful without you."</p>
            <p>Omari floew down on a bird and looked Eric right in the eyes, Eric smiled, reached out and hugged his long lost brother.</p>
