            <p>After a terrible amount of name-calling and tons of grouchy face-making, Omari took off for the town junkyard and their dog, Oats followed. Oats absolutely hated jerks.</p>
            <p>Eric sat in his empty tree fort alone. He tried being wild and reckless but he just felt sad and brother-less. Looking around he said, "What am I supposed to do now, make friends with the pinecones?

If he likes playing house so much he should just build himself a wooden wife and make some kids out of macaroni and glue. They could all bake mud pies, roll some turds into spaghetti, and throw tea parties like little babies."</p>
            <p>Eric kicked through the wall and roared like a gorilla, "If you like this fort so much, why don't you kiss it!" Eric pushed his little brother way too hard. Omari tripped and smashed his head right into a big panel of buttons, knobs, and switches, and then..."</p>
