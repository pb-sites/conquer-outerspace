            <p>Oats couldn't hold back. He tackled the brothers and slobbered all over the both of them. "Alright already!" Omari gasped through all the horrible dog breath, "Let's go home!"</p>
            <p>An idea struck Eric like a lightning bolt, "I know how we can go back! We have two broken rocket ships; let's combines both ships into one big ship that actually works!" Omari jumped right into action. Flapping and squawking orders, he sent his birds flying. In minutes, both rocket ships were on the ground ready for inspection.</p>

            <p>"Ok," Eric said, "if we're going to build a new ship out of these pieces of junk we need three things: armor for the outer shell, power for the engines, and some wings so we can steer the ship - I really don't want to crash again. Anybody have any ideas?"</p>
            <p>Crom scratched his monstorous chin, flipped through his book and said, "I have a few ideas. You Thatcher brothers aren't afraid of a little adventure are you?"</p>
            <p>The brothers both yelled "No!", jumped on the backs of two red birds and flew off after Crom. Soon they were out at sea, looking up into the face of a gigantic fisherman.</p>
