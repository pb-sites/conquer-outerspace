            <p>Eric called out, "Alright everyone, climb on board, and I mean everyone!"</p>
            <p>A cheer went up in camp. Omari walked over to Crom and said, "Crom, our planet could really use a wild and horrible space monster. Want to come visit?"</p>
            <p>Crom laughed and a great big booming laugh, "Omari, you and Eric are more horrible and wild than I'll ever be. Let's load up the ship and take you two monsters home!" Eric took the controls and said, "Ok, here goes nothing." He hit the ignition and the engines started rumbling. Omari felt the rumbling under his feet; then like a caterpillar it crawled up into his belly, then into his ears where it became a tickle. He started laughing, and then with a huge CROAK! the ship shot into space.</p>

            <p>It was just another quiet night in Stubbsville. Crickets chriped while the townspeople dozed off to sleep and snored. Everyone was peacefully at rest until the sound of blasting rockets and extremely loud croaking sent the whole town into a total panic.</p>
