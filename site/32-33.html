            <p>Back in the air, Eric thought out loud, "I can rebuild the main propulsion engines but we have no fuel. Without some way to power the engines we're stuck like a slug in salt."</p>
            <p>Crom had an idea. He led the brothers to a very LOUD swamp, "This is the home of the Three Horned Blast Frogs. Stick some mud in your ears because one croak from these frogs can blast the eardrums right out of your head. We just need to catch a few frogs and we'll have enough to croak energy to make about three hundred space ships fly."</p>
            <p>Oats was expecially good at catching the supersonic frogs. Omari, on the other hand, got his whole leg stuck in the swamp and lost one of his shoes for good.</p>

            <p>Next the brothers followed Crom to the cast Many-Colored Desert where the monster lowered Eric and Mari down an ancient dried-up well. Crom called down to the brothers, "We only need one more thing to complete your ship. We need wings!"</p>
            <p>Omari yelled back, "I don't see any wings down here, Crom. I only see crystals."</p>
            <p>"Good!" Crom called back. "Grab as many as you can, those candy crystals are the favorite snack food of the most dangerous animals on the planet: Lighting Monkeys! We can trade those crystals with the monkeys for your wings. Now let's go!"</p>
